#### Further Concepts from **"鬼谷子" (Guiguzi) Modeled in Prolog (Computer Science)**

Building on **鬼谷子**’s ideas of strategic thinking and subtle influence, we can expand our Prolog model to include concepts of **權變** (adaptability) and **意圖辨識** (intention recognition). These strategies allow entities to adjust their actions based on the changing intentions and power of others, a hallmark of Guiguzi’s adaptable philosophy.

Here’s an advanced Prolog code snippet to represent adaptability and intention recognition:

```prolog
% Basic relationships
trust(X, Y) :- shared_values(X, Y), history_of_cooperation(X, Y).
influence(X, Y) :- power(X), alliance(X, Y).
adapt(X, Y, Z) :- influence(X, Y), respond_to_intent(Y, Z).

% Defining shared values, cooperation history, and power
shared_values(general, advisor).
history_of_cooperation(general, advisor).
power(general).

% Recognizing intentions
intention(advisor, assist).
intention(enemy, sabotage).
respond_to_intent(advisor, assist) :- trust(general, advisor).
respond_to_intent(enemy, sabotage) :- influence(general, enemy).

% Example queries
% To determine if an entity adapts based on intent:
% ?- adapt(general, advisor, assist).
% Expected result: true

% Checking influence based on power dynamics and adaptability:
% ?- influence(general, advisor).
% Expected result: true
```

This extension captures **Guiguzi’s** emphasis on adaptability, showing how intentions affect actions within alliances. The `adapt` predicate demonstrates how the entity (e.g., `general`) can adjust their strategy based on `advisor`'s intent, creating a dynamic response framework inspired by Guiguzi’s philosophy.
