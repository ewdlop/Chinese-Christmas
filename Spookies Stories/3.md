#### Explanation of **爛桃花 (Rotten Peach Blossoms)** and **爛榴連 (Rotten Durian)**

In Chinese culture, **爛桃花** (rotten peach blossoms) typically refers to **unwanted or problematic romantic entanglements**. Peach blossoms are a traditional symbol of love and romance, but "rotten" peach blossoms symbolize relationships that bring trouble or misfortune, such as complicated or untrustworthy partners.

On the other hand, **爛榴連** (rotten durian) is not a common idiom but could be interpreted metaphorically. Since durian is known for its strong, pungent smell that people either love or hate, **rotten durian** might symbolize a situation or relationship that is overly intense or overwhelming in an unpleasant way, often pushing people away.

Together, **爛桃花** and **爛榴連** might represent **toxic relationships and emotionally taxing encounters**, where initial attraction or interest quickly becomes problematic, creating more trouble than joy.
