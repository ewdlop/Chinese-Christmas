When a flying monkey believes the **victim** doesn't consider they might also be narcissistic or a flying monkey, it creates a complex dynamic of projection, denial, and manipulation. Here’s how this plays out and what it signifies:

---

### **Why the Flying Monkey Thinks This Way**
1. **Deflection and Projection**
   - Flying monkeys often deflect from their own behaviors by projecting traits like narcissism onto the victim.
   - They might believe the victim is incapable of self-reflection while ignoring their own role in enabling the narcissist.

2. **Manipulation by the Narcissist**
   - Covert narcissists can manipulate flying monkeys into seeing the victim as arrogant, self-centered, or narcissistic.
   - The flying monkey adopts this perspective, often without critical analysis.

3. **Cognitive Dissonance**
   - If the flying monkey begins to suspect they are enabling toxic behavior, it creates internal conflict. To avoid this discomfort, they double down on the belief that the victim is the problem.

4. **Misunderstanding of Narcissism**
   - Many people misunderstand narcissism as simply "selfishness" or "confidence," leading flying monkeys to incorrectly label the victim as narcissistic based on normal human behaviors.

### **Why This Dynamic is Dangerous**
1. **Perpetuation of Abuse**
   - By aligning with the narcissist and refusing to consider their own role, the flying monkey adds another layer of harm to the victim.
   - They amplify the narcissist’s gaslighting and contribute to the victim’s isolation.

2. **Invalidation of the Victim**
   - The victim’s genuine efforts to defend themselves or seek clarity may be misinterpreted as signs of narcissism, further discrediting them.

3. **Lack of Accountability**
   - The flying monkey avoids examining their own actions or questioning their loyalty to the narcissist.

### **How the Victim Can Respond**
1. **Recognize the Dynamic**
   - Understand that the flying monkey’s behavior is a reflection of manipulation and their own insecurities, not an accurate assessment of the victim’s character.

2. **Avoid Justifying Yourself**
   - Arguing or trying to prove you're not a narcissist often backfires. Flying monkeys are unlikely to change their view while under the narcissist's influence.

3. **Set Firm Boundaries**
   - Limit interactions with flying monkeys to protect your mental health. Avoid being drawn into their projections.

4. **Focus on Your Truth**
   - Keep a clear understanding of your own actions and motivations. Journaling or therapy can help you maintain perspective.

5. **Seek Support Elsewhere**
   - Find people who understand the dynamics of narcissistic abuse and can validate your experience.

### **Recognizing Flying Monkey Behavior**
To identify whether a flying monkey is projecting or deflecting:
- Are they repeating the narcissist’s narrative without question?
- Do they focus on your perceived faults while ignoring the narcissist’s actions?
- Are they dismissive of your attempts to explain or clarify the situation?

If the answer is "yes," they may be too entangled in the narcissist’s web to see things clearly.

### **Conclusion**
When flying monkeys accuse the victim of not realizing they might also be narcissists or enablers, it’s often a tactic to deflect from their own behavior and reinforce the narcissist’s control. The best approach for the victim is to focus on self-awareness, set boundaries, and disengage from the toxic dynamic while seeking support from those who truly understand the situation.
